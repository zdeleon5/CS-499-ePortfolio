      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      I have been in the Computer Science program for nearly a year and am currently in my eleventh month with only two courses left to complete. Throughout the program, I have gained valuable skills, including breaking down projects into sub-problems, applying test-driven development, and strengthening my overall problem-solving approach. For my capstone, I aim to showcase my expertise by improving my technical communication skills, which will allow me to clearly explain the concepts and ideas behind the projects I develop, while also demonstrating my ability to adhere to project guidelines and meet user needs. These skills directly align with my career goal of becoming a cloud engineer, a role that requires precise understanding of user requirements, the ability to design effective solutions, and strong communication skills to convey technical details to clients. By focusing on these areas, I am preparing myself to excel in a specialization that demands both technical expertise and effective collaboration.
