    <h1>Software Design and Engineering</h1>
    <p>The artifact I have chosen is my final project for CS-340, an animal shelter analytical dashboard written in Python with data stored in a MongoDB database. This project, created in April 2025, demonstrates my ability to build data-driven applications and integrate non-relational databases into software solutions.
    <p>I included this artifact in my ePortfolio because it highlights my ability to interface with the data layer of a project, a critical skill in software development since most applications rely on data handling. To improve the project, I added a SQL database that allows the animal shelter to track volunteers and manage their shifts, showcasing my versatility with both relational and non-relational databases.</p>
    <p>In terms of course outcomes, I believe I successfully met my goal of applying innovative techniques by implementing a dual-database approach. Each database serves a distinct purpose, which establishes a clear separation of concerns and strengthens the projectâ€™s design.</p>
    <p>Through the process of enhancing and modifying this artifact, I learned how to frame technical problems from a business perspective. One challenge was simulating a production environment, which I addressed by using a SQLite database as a stand-in. Moving forward, I plan to enhance the project further by adding an API server in Express.js and transitioning to a production-ready database such as PostgreSQL or MySQL to prepare the project for deployment.</p></p>
